# 🐶🐱 Dog & Cat Classification Project 🖼️

## Description
The Dog & Cat Classification project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at accurately classifying images of dogs and cats using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Leveraging a dataset containing labeled images of these furry friends, the project demonstrates the prowess of CNNs in image classification tasks.

## Libraries Used 📚
The project harnesses the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow 🧠
- Keras 🤖
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📊
- Pandas (for data analysis, if applicable) 🐼

## Requirements 🛠️
To run the Dog & Cat Classification project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install keras
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```
In addition, you'll need to import the necessary TensorFlow Keras layers:

```bash
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
```

## Dataset 📸

To use the dataset for the Dog & Cat Classification project, follow these steps:

1. Access the following link to download the dataset: [Dataset Download Link](Dataset_Download_Link)

2. Once downloaded, extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired location on your local machine.

3. Ensure that the extracted dataset folder is accessible and located in the appropriate directory specified in your code.

4. Use the following code snippet to extract the dataset programmatically:

```python
from zipfile import ZipFile
file_name = "/content/drive/My Drive/dataset_new.zip"

# Extract the contents of the ZIP file
with ZipFile(file_name, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("/desired/extract/location")
```
## Installation Instructions 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the command mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset_new/` directory.

## Training Instructions 📝

To train the model from scratch using the dataset:

1. Import the necessary libraries and dataset.
2. Preprocess the images (e.g., resize, normalization, augmentation).
3. Define the model architecture.
4. Compile and train the model using the specified hyperparameters.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation metrics described in the "Model Evaluation" section.

## Model Evaluation 📊

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Loss: Binary crossentropy
- Accuracy: Binary accuracy

These metrics are calculated during the model training process and displayed in the training logs.
